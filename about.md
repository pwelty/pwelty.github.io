This is the place where I talk about my non-work-related interests. And since this can be a pretty varied set of topics, I call this blog &#8220;Polymathic&#8221;. This means you can read here about anything from philosophy to web programming. Most of the posts are an archive of interesting things that have reference value for future readers.

 If anything here is useful or interesting, just leave a comment, trackback, or send me an email.
